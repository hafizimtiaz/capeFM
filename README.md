Decentralied Differentially Private Functional Mechanism (capeFM)
=====================================
This repository includes MATLAB implementation of the capeFM algorithm that can achieve the same utility as the pooled-data scenario in an honest-but-curious model. Please see the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10059 

The repository contains the codes for the following:
* common functions -- necessary functions
* datasets -- synthetic and real datasets used for the simulations 
* plots -- codes for generating plots from saved results
* vs delta -- codes for variation of performance with $$\delta$$
* vs epsilon -- codes for variation of performance with $$\epsilon$$
* vs samples -- codes for variation of performance with number of samples
